# Script: create_users_one_real_others_dummy.sh
# Purpose: Securely create one REAL (team) user with sudo privileges and
#          multiple dummy (decoy) user accounts. The REAL user is forced
#          to change their password on first login and has a secure ~/.ssh
#          directory set up for future SSH key deployment. The dummy users
#          are created with a restricted shell (rbash) and then immediately
#          locked to prevent login.
#
# Usage: Run as root:
#    sudo ./create_users_one_real_others_dummy.sh
