# Script: create_users_secure.sh
# Purpose: Securely create real (team) and decoy (fake) user accounts with
#          very secure, randomly generated hex passwords.
#
#   - REAL USERS: Added to sudo, forced to change their password on first login,
#     and provided with a secure ~/.ssh directory for later key deployment.
#
#   - FAKE USERS: Created with a restricted shell (rbash) and immediately locked.
#
#   - Strict directory permissions are applied:
#         * REAL users: home directories set to 700.
#         * FAKE users: home directories set to 750.
#
# Usage: Run as root:
#    sudo ./create_users_secure.sh
